## **üìë Information**
This is a mod for [Minecraft]-[Forge] and [Fabric].<br>

It makes it easy to automatically keep items and fluids in your Applied Energistics 2 ME-System in stock.<br>
The ME Requester can host 5 requests by default. You can place as many of them as you like on your system
and remote access them through the ME Requester Terminal. The terminal allows you to configure the
requests and monitor the status remotely.

The number of slots a Requester supports can be configured as well as its channel and idle energy usage.

If you previously used the mod [Lazier AE2], you might be familiar with the Requester. We decided to decouple
the Requester features from it and make it a standalone mod.

The whole system has been rewritten and also supports fluids!

## **üîß Manual Installation**
1. Download the latest **mod jar** from the [releases], from [CurseForge] or from [Modrinth].
2. Install Minecraft [Forge] or [Fabric].
3. Drop the **jar file** into your mods folder.

## **‚è∞ Changelog**
Everything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].
